# Welcome to the Coom 

The [Coom](https://thecoom.xyz) is a group of friends based on the internet and later has it's own Minecraft SMP that got a lot of unique people to play it and the group is constantly growing everyday.

The Minecraft SMP is also improving as the developer is also trying to fix it almost every single day. The community only aim one thing, for people to enjoy the server and to be connected with one another. Despite of having *Clan wars* people still have fun. 

The server may not profit in any ways but I will find a way to have the thing the server needs. From giveaways to hosting. I do not care if I ran out of money by funding most of my personal money, if I can see the server achieve it's main goal, fun for everyone.

You can also join our Minecraft server; nsmp.thecoom.xyz using version 1.16.2 or join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zVgBqdyNyJ)!

Our server has a verification system that requires user to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zVgBqdyNyJ) before joining because since this is a Cracked server, user can just easily impersonate other people by using their Minecraft username.
